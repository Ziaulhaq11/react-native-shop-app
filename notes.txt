Ionicons issue

uninstall expo-font from node modules

DON'T SKIP THIS LECTURE - PLEASE READ TO BOTTOM!

If you're using React Navigation v4 or higher, everything works as shown in this module but there is one important difference: You need to install the different navigators which we'll use in this module (StackNavigator, DrawerNavigator, TabsNavigator) separately.

So when we use the StackNavigator (= next lecture), run

npm install --save react-navigation-stack
before you start using it (with v3 and lower, it was part of react-navigation itself).

Also add this import in the file where you are using createStackNavigator:

import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack';
Same for TabsNavigator (used a little bit later in this module):

npm install --save react-navigation-tabs
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from 'react-navigation-tabs';
And also for DrawerNavigator (also used later in this module):

npm install --save react-navigation-drawer
import { createDrawerNavigator } from 'react-navigation-drawer';

Async storage
expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

And import like this
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';


THUNK : A function that delays an action until later 
An action creator function that does NOT return the action itself but another function which eventually return the function

If we modify data in server and then we opened our application which was already opened and then move pages back and fourth but the data is not yet updated. Because those pages are not rerendering React Navigation saves the screens which we already which we visit in memory. When it is first time visit then it is loading. else it just showing the previous one from meomory
